# Network Security Monitoring Lab

Home lab project for analyzing network traffic and detecting security threats.

## What I Used

- Python
- Wireshark
- Splunk
- Nmap
- Linux

## What I Did

### Step 1: Set Up Lab Environment
Set up VirtualBox with a few VMs to create a test network. One VM for attacking, one for monitoring, one as the target.

### Step 2: Captured Network Traffic
Used Wireshark to capture packets on the network. Set it to capture everything so I could see what's happening on the network.

### Step 3: Analyzed with Splunk
Configured Splunk to read the network logs from Wireshark. Set up some basic dashboards to visualize the traffic patterns.

### Step 4: Python Scripts
Wrote Python scripts to parse through logs automatically and look for suspicious activity like port scans or failed login attempts. Scripts send alerts when they find something.

### Step 5: Tested Detection
Ran Nmap scans and other attacks against my test network to see if my monitoring setup could detect them. It caught most of the attacks.

### Step 6: Made Dashboards
Created Splunk dashboards showing network activity, alerts, and top traffic sources.

## Results

The lab successfully detected port scans and suspicious network activity. Python scripts reduced the time spent manually checking logs.

## What I Learned

- How to analyze network traffic
- Setting up SIEM tools
- Python automation for security monitoring
- Detecting different types of network attacks
